            Exploring the nature and using my camera to frame them is my another passion. Together with the ability to process images allow me to create my own contents.

            This website is a showcase of my works, it was one of my first React projects therefore its infrastructure is far away from ideal, but there are many more interesting things I'm excited to try out, so I will just patch it up instead of starting over again for now. \n
            This website also serves as my playground: whenever I see some new thrilling techniques, I try to apply them into this website. And for the learning purpose, I attempt to use as few external package as possible. \n
